Face Recognition Attendance System
📌 Project Overview

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a computer vision-based application designed to automate the attendance process using facial recognition technology. The system captures live video input, detects and recognizes faces in real time, and automatically records attendance, minimizing manual intervention and improving accuracy and efficiency.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of face detection, face encoding, and real-time recognition for smart attendance management systems.
